Detailed deployment guide coming soon.

## Overview

Kinotic OS deploys to Kubernetes and provides several deployment configurations for different environments.

## Deployment Options

### Helm Charts

Production-ready Helm charts are available in `deployment/helm/` for deploying:

- **Kinotic Server** — The core platform with configurable replicas, resource limits, and ingress
- **Elasticsearch** — Search and persistence cluster
- **Load Generator** — For performance testing

### Docker Compose (Local Development)

A Docker Compose configuration in `deployment/docker-compose/` provides a complete local development environment including the Kinotic server, Elasticsearch, and supporting services. This is the recommended way to run Kinotic OS during development.

### KinD (Kubernetes in Docker)

For testing Kubernetes deployments locally, `deployment/kind/` provides a KinD setup with Terraform configurations that deploy the full stack into a local Kubernetes cluster.

### Cloud Providers (Terraform)

Terraform configurations in `deployment/terraform/` support deployment to:

- **AWS** — EC2-based deployment with configurable instance types
- **Azure** — VM-based deployment on Azure infrastructure

#### UI sites on Azure

`frontdoor.tf` calls `deployment/terraform/azure/modules/sites`, which creates everything a
published UI needs, once per environment, so nothing on Front Door, in DNS or in storage is
created when a UI is published: the sites storage account `st<prefix>sites` every site's
files live in under `sites/<hostname>/`, the Front Door Standard profile and endpoint every
site is served through, a Let's Encrypt wildcard certificate for `*.apps.<zone>` issued into
the cluster key vault by a DNS challenge and renewed by an apply within 30 days of expiry,
the wildcard custom domain and DNS record, an origin group that reads the account as the
profile's managed identity, and the route whose rules serve `sites/<hostname>/` for a
request's host. The module grants that identity Storage Blob Data Reader on the account and
the kinotic-server identity Storage Blob Data Contributor, with which the server signs the
URLs the publish and removal workloads act through, and `kinotic.tf` passes the sites domain
and the account's blob endpoint as `KINOTIC_SYSTEMAPI_UIDEPLOYMENT_*` environment variables
(see [Configuration](/platform/configuration#ui-sites)). The certificate is issued by the
principal terraform runs as, which needs `lets_encrypt_email` set and holds Key Vault
Certificates Officer on the vault; the profile's identity is unknown until the profile
exists, so a first apply targets `module.sites.azurerm_cdn_frontdoor_profile.sites` before
applying the rest. The `kinotic-server` values file for development disables the provisioner
instead.

A developer machine gets the same module from `deployment/terraform/azure/dev`, under
`apps-<environment>.<zone>` with a key vault of its own. The
[contributing guide](/platform/contributing#publishing-uis-against-azure) walks through it.
