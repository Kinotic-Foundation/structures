## Building

### Java/Kotlin Backend

```bash
./gradlew build
```

### TypeScript SDK

```bash
cd kinotic-js
bun install
bun run build
```

### Website

```bash
cd website
bun install
bun run dev
```

## Testing

### Java/Kotlin

```bash
./gradlew test
```

### TypeScript (Vitest)

```bash
cd kinotic-js
bun test
```

### Publishing UIs against Azure

The development profile marks every published UI ready without uploading or serving it. To
exercise the real path — sites published into a sites account and served through Front Door —
point the server at a subscription of your own.

Create what the server cannot create itself, once:

```bash
az login
cd deployment/terraform/azure/dev
terraform init
terraform apply -target=module.sites.azurerm_cdn_frontdoor_profile.sites   # the profile's identity first: its principal id is unknown until it exists
terraform apply   # environment = "local" in terraform.tfvars; lets_encrypt_email in local.auto.tfvars
terraform output -raw application_local_yml > ../../../../kinotic-server/src/main/resources/application-local.yml
```

That is a resource group with the sites storage account, a Front Door Standard profile with
an endpoint and an identity that reads the account, the `apps-<environment>.<zone>` sites
domain on a Let's Encrypt wildcard certificate in a key vault of its own, and a service
principal for the server with the roles it needs: Storage Blob Data Contributor on the
account, with which it signs each site's upload and removal URLs, and Contributor on the
email service, so it sends mail too. The written file is the git-ignored `local` profile: it
turns the site provisioner on and names the domain and the account. The `environment` is
yours alone: a site hostname can be bound to one Front Door profile in all of Azure, so two
developers sharing a sites domain would collide.

The principal's `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`, `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET` and `AZURE_TENANT_ID` are written to
`.env.local` at the repository root, which git ignores, as a commented block after a blank
line. When the file exists its other lines are kept and the block a previous apply wrote is
replaced, or appended if absent. Run the server with that file in its environment;
`DefaultAzureCredential` takes those variables before anything else, so the server signs as
the principal whatever `az login` is signed in as. A role assignment takes a minute or two to
become visible; a publish before that fails with `AuthorizationFailed` on the workload, and
the next deploy of the project succeeds.

Run the server with both profiles:

```bash
SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=development,local
```

A developer machine is outside any platform VNet, so the publish workload reaches the sites
account over its public endpoint, which the workload's egress allowlist names.

Before involving the server, publish a site against your subscription from a test. It does
what a deployment does for a site `azure-it.apps-<environment>.<zone>`, uploading through an
upload URL and reading back through Front Door what it published, and checks that the URLs
it issues act on one site's directory alone, so a step Azure rejects fails naming the call:

```bash
./gradlew :kinotic-system-api:test --tests '*AzureProvisioningIntegrationTest*'
```

The module's test task puts `.env.local` in the test's environment, and the test reads your
`application-local.yml`; without either it skips. What it publishes is left in place, so a
second run is quick, and `terraform destroy` removes it with the account.

Then deploy a project that contains a UI; the deployment publishes it into the sites account
and the site serves at `https://<label>.apps-<environment>.<zone>` as soon as its files are
up, which shows as the deployment turning from provisioning to ready within moments.

`terraform destroy` removes the resource group with the account, the profile and the key
vault, and the wildcard records under `apps-<environment>` in the platform's DNS zone.

## Submitting Changes

1. Fork the repository and create a feature branch from `develop`
2. Make your changes with clear, descriptive commit messages
3. Ensure all tests pass before submitting
4. Submit a pull request against the `develop` branch
