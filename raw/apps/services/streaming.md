# Streaming

> Real-time data streaming between services and clients.

Kinotic services can push multiple values to callers over time using the streaming pattern. Instead of returning a single response, a streaming method returns an `Observable` that emits values as they become available.

## Defining a Streaming Method

Any service method that returns an `Observable` is treated as a streaming endpoint.

```typescript
import { Publish } from '@kinotic-ai/core'
import { Observable, interval } from 'rxjs'
import { map } from 'rxjs/operators'

@Publish('com.example')
class SensorService {
    streamReadings(sensorId: string): Observable<SensorReading> {
        return interval(1000).pipe(
            map(() => ({
                sensorId,
                value: Math.random() * 100,
                timestamp: new Date()
            }))
        )
    }
}
```

## Consuming a Stream

Callers receive an `Observable` and subscribe to process values as they arrive.

```typescript
const stream$ = sensorService.streamReadings('sensor-1')

const subscription = stream$.subscribe({
    next: (reading) => console.log('Reading:', reading.value),
    error: (err) => console.error('Stream error:', err),
    complete: () => console.log('Stream ended')
})

// Stop listening when done
subscription.unsubscribe()
```

## How a Stream Ends

A stream ends for its caller in one of four ways, and the service stops producing in every one of them:

- **The service completes it.** The caller's `Observable` completes.
- **The service fails it.** The caller's `Observable` errors with the exception the service threw or emitted.
- **The caller unsubscribes.** A cancel reaches the service, which unsubscribes from the `Observable` the method returned, so a finite source stops early and an `interval` stops ticking.
- **The caller is gone.** The platform watches the caller's reply destination for every stream in progress, on the node hosting a Java service and on the gateway for a TypeScript one. When nothing listens there any more — the caller's connection closed, or its node left the cluster — the stream is cancelled the same way an unsubscribe cancels it. A TypeScript service whose own connection ends, however it ends, cancels every stream it was producing at that moment, because the gateway has already failed those callers (see [service call liveness](/platform/service-call-liveness)).

A service that stops while producing a stream ends it with an error at the caller rather than a silent cancel.

## Use Cases

- **Real-time data feeds** -- IoT sensors, live metrics, dashboards
- **Notifications and alerts** -- Push updates to connected clients
- **Change data capture** -- React to data changes as they happen
- **Large result sets** -- Stream results incrementally instead of loading everything at once
