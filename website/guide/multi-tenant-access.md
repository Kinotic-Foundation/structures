# Multi-Tenant Access
Multi-tenant field is a feature that when enabled will provide additional "Admin" level functionality. 
This will include additional methods that allow for data to viewed and managed across all tenants. 
This means users will be able to view and manage data from all tenants, not just the tenant they are currently logged into.

## Enabling Multi-Tenant Access
To enable multi-tenant access, you will add the @TenantId annotation to a field in the entity class.
This will allow the field to be used as a tenant identifier.

```typescript

@Entity(MultiTenancyType.SHARED)
export class Person {
    @AutoGeneratedId
    public id: string | null = null
    public firstName: string = ''
    public lastName: string = ''

    @TenantId
    public tenantId: string = ''

}

```
