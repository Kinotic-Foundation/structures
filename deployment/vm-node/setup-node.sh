# Provisions a node to run Kinotic workloads as Kata microVMs on Cloud Hypervisor, driven
# through the Docker Engine API. Idempotent: safe to re-run on a node already set up.
# README.md beside this script says what each step establishes and why.
#
# Docker rather than containerd's CRI for two reasons neither is obvious from the outside:
# CRI has no per-container rootfs size (containerd applies base_image_size per snapshotter,
# not per container), while Docker's --storage-opt size does, and Docker has a maintained
# Node client where CRI has none. Docker still runs the workload through containerd and the
# Kata shim, so the isolation is identical; only the control plane differs.
#
# Everything here has to survive a reboot, because a node that comes back without its XFS
# data root or its firewall rules keeps accepting workloads while silently enforcing nothing.
# verify-node.sh asserts every invariant this script establishes and is run at the end.
