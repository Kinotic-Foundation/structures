# Azure Cost Projection

Estimated monthly costs for `centralus` (the `location` in `cluster/terraform.tfvars` and
`global/terraform.tfvars`). Prices are approximate (pay-as-you-go).

---

## Beta (`beta_mode = true`, default)

Dedicated master + 3 data ES nodes on shared system pool. Production-like
ES topology without dedicated VMs. Uses Premium ZRS storage (same as
production) so the beta → production path requires no storage migration.
Includes observability stack (Loki + Alloy + Grafana) and Entra ID auth.

| Line Item | Spec | Count | Unit cost | Total/mo |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| System VMs | Standard_D4s_v5 (4 vCPU, 16 GB) | 3 | $140 | $420 |
| System OS Disks | Premium SSD, 128 GB | 3 | $19 | $57 |
| ES Master PVC | Premium ZRS, 16 GB | 1 | $10 | $10 |
| ES Data PVCs | Premium ZRS, 64 GB | 3 | $19 | $57 |
| LB + Public IP (STOMP only) | Standard | 1 | $22 | $22 |
| Static Web App (SPA) | Free tier | 1 | $0 | $0 |
| Loki PVC | managed-csi-premium, 10 GB | 1 | $2 | $2 |
| Grafana PVC | managed-csi-premium, 1 GB | 1 | $1 | $1 |
| Key Vault | Standard | 1 | ~$0.03/10K ops | $1 |
| Azure Communication Services | Email | 1 | $0.00025/email | $0 |
| DNS Zone | kinotic.ai | 1 | $0.50 | $1 |
| State Storage | Blob (LRS) | 1 | $1 | $1 |
| Front Door Standard (UI sites) | Base fee | 1 | $35 | $35 |
| Private DNS Zone (blob) | privatelink.blob.core.windows.net | 1 | $0.50 | $1 |
| Organization storage | Storage account + private endpoint | per org | ~$7.50 | +$7.50 per org |

### Beta Total: ~$609/mo, plus ~$7.50 per organization

### Beta Resource Utilization (48 GB across 3 nodes)

Kubernetes reserves ~2 GB per node, leaving ~42 GB usable.
Memory reservations (requests) determine scheduling, not actual usage.

| Pod | Memory (reserved) | Count | Total |
|---|---|---|---|
| ES master | 2 GB | 1 | 2 GB |
| ES data | 6 GB | 3 | 18 GB |
| kinotic-server | 2 GB | 2 | 4 GB |
| Loki | 512 MB | 1 | 0.5 GB |
| Grafana | 256 MB | 1 | 0.25 GB |
| Alloy (per node) | 256 MB | 3 | 0.75 GB |
| System (kube, ECK, cert-mgr, Reloader, Cilium) | — | — | ~5 GB |
| **Reserved** | | | **~30.5 GB** |
| **Available for rolling updates** | | | **~11.5 GB** |

**Beta sizing notes:**
- ES data reduced from 8 GB to 6 GB (actual usage ~4.6 GB per pod)
- kinotic-server at 2 replicas (3 in production)
- Loki caches disabled (chunksCache, resultsCache) — not needed at beta volume
- Alloy DaemonSet runs on every node, minimal memory

---

## Production (`beta_mode = false`)

Dedicated ES node pool, 3 master + 3 data ES nodes, system pool tainted.
AKS Standard tier with uptime SLA.

| Line Item | Spec | Count | Unit cost | Total/mo |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| System VMs | Standard_D4s_v5 (4 vCPU, 16 GB) | 3 | $140 | $420 |
| System OS Disks | Premium SSD, 128 GB | 3 | $19 | $57 |
| ES VMs | Standard_E8s_v5 (8 vCPU, 64 GB) | 3 | $365 | $1,095 |
| ES OS Disks | Premium SSD, 256 GB | 3 | $38 | $114 |
| ES Master PVCs | Premium ZRS, 32 GB | 3 | $10 | $30 |
| ES Data PVCs | Premium ZRS, 256 GB | 3 | $74 | $222 |
| AKS Standard Tier | Uptime SLA (99.95%) | 1 | $73 | $73 |
| LB + Public IP (STOMP only) | Standard | 1 | $22 | $22 |
| Static Web App (SPA) | Free tier | 1 | $0 | $0 |
| Key Vault | Standard | 1 | ~$0.03/10K ops | $1 |
| Azure Communication Services | Email | 1 | $0.00025/email | $0 |
| Loki PVC | managed-csi-premium, 10 GB | 1 | $2 | $2 |
| Loki Blob Storage | Azure Blob (hot tier) | — | ~$0.02/GB | $5 |
| Grafana PVC | managed-csi-premium, 1 GB | 1 | $1 | $1 |
| DNS Zone | kinotic.ai | 1 | $0.50 | $1 |
| State Storage | Blob (LRS) | 1 | $1 | $1 |
| Front Door Standard (UI sites) | Base fee | 1 | $35 | $35 |
| Private DNS Zone (blob) | privatelink.blob.core.windows.net | 1 | $0.50 | $1 |
| Organization storage | Storage account + private endpoint | per org | ~$7.50 | +$7.50 per org |

### Production Total: ~$2,061/mo, plus ~$7.50 per organization

The per-organization line is the private endpoint; the account itself is cents. At a
thousand organizations that is ~$7,300/mo, which is where service endpoints or a shared
account layout would earn a redesign (see the "Deferred" section of the project publishing
design).

---

## Developer environment (`dev/`)

One per developer, created by `dev/` (see [dev/README.md](dev/README.md)). No VNet, no
private endpoints, no cluster.

| Line Item | Spec | Count | Unit cost | Total/mo |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Front Door Standard (UI sites) | Base fee, billed hourly | 1 | $35 | $35 |
| Organization storage accounts | Blob (LRS, hot), a few MB each | per org | cents | ~$0 |
| Service principal, role assignments, resource group | | | $0 | $0 |
| DNS records under `apps-<environment>` | In the shared `kinotic.ai` zone | | included | $0 |

### Developer Total: ~$35/mo while it exists

The base fee is billed by the hour, so `terraform destroy` between testing sessions stops
it, and `terraform apply` brings the environment back in a few minutes.

---

## Scaling from Beta to Production

```hcl
# In terraform.tfvars:
beta_mode = false
```

One `terraform apply`:
- Adds ES dedicated node pool (3x Standard_E8s_v5 across 3 AZs)
- Switches eck-stack values from `values-azure-beta.yaml` to `values-azure.yaml`
- ECK migrates ES pods from system pool to dedicated pool
- System pool gets `CriticalAddonsOnly` taint
- AKS tier upgrades from Free to Standard (SLA)

## Cost Reduction Options

| Optimization | Savings | Trade-off |
|---|---|---|
| Reserved Instances (1yr, system VMs) | ~30% on compute | Commitment |
| Reserved Instances (1yr, ES VMs) | ~30% on compute | Commitment |
| Spot instances (non-critical workloads) | ~60-90% on compute | Can be evicted |
| Smaller ES VMs (E4s_v5 instead of E8s_v5) | ~$550/mo | Less memory per node |
