## Overview

Kinotic provides a unified policy expression language for controlling access to both **published service methods** and **entity data**. The same `@AbacPolicy` expression syntax works in both contexts — the platform routes enforcement to the appropriate layer based on where the policy is applied.

| Placement | Enforcement Point |
|-----------|------------------|
| Service method | Before invocation -- the call is rejected if the policy fails |
| Entity decorator | At the data layer -- unauthorized records are never returned |

## Design Philosophy

Many authorization frameworks claim to "accelerate development by decoupling authorization from business logic." In practice, authorization is never truly decoupled from business logic — it is deeply intertwined with it. A policy that checks `order.amount < participant.spendingLimit` is inherently coupled to the data model it protects. The question is where that coupling lives.

External policy engines move policy definitions to YAML files or scripts in a separate repository. The claim is "decoupled." But what you actually get is:

- Policy files that reference field names from your data model
- Convention-based coupling between service names and policy resource kinds
- A separate deployment pipeline for policies that has to stay in sync with code changes
- Developers context-switching between their code and a policy repo to understand what is actually enforced

That is not decoupled — it is **indirectly coupled**, which is harder to reason about.

Kinotic takes the opposite approach: **make the coupling explicit and co-located**.

```typescript
@AbacPolicy("order.amount < participant.spendingLimit")
placeOrder(order: Order): void { }
```

The policy sits right on the method it protects. A developer reads the method signature, sees the parameter names in the expression, and immediately understands the access rule. There is no policy file to hunt down, no naming convention to remember, no separate deployment to coordinate.

The real benefit these frameworks provide is separating the **evaluation engine** from business code — ensuring developers never write `if (user.role !== 'finance') throw new Error()` in their services. Kinotic provides this same benefit. The expression is declarative, not imperative. The platform handles enforcement. Service code contains zero authorization logic. But the policy lives where you can see it, right next to the code it governs.

## Expression Language

Policy expressions use a simple, developer-friendly syntax with dotted attribute paths, comparison operators, and boolean logic.

### Attribute Paths

Expressions reference attributes using dotted notation. The root identifier determines what the path resolves against:

- **`participant`** — the authenticated caller (roles, department, limits, etc.)
- **`context`** — the request environment (time, IP, etc.)
- **Any other root** — resolved against method parameter names (service methods) or the entity being accessed (entity decorators)

### Operators

| Operator | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `==` | Equals | `participant.department == 'engineering'` |
| `!=` | Not equals | `entity.status != 'archived'` |
| `<` | Less than | `order.amount < 50000` |
| `>` | Greater than | `entity.priority > 3` |
| `<=` | Less than or equal | `transfer.amount <= participant.transferLimit` |
| `>=` | Greater than or equal | `entity.score >= 80` |
| `contains` | Collection membership | `participant.roles contains 'admin'` |
| `in` | Value in set | `entity.status in ['active', 'pending']` |
| `exists` | Field presence | `entity.approvedBy exists` |
| `like` | Pattern match | `entity.email like '*@kinotic.ai'` |

### Boolean Logic

Combine conditions with `and`, `or`, and `not`. Parentheses override default precedence. Keywords are case-insensitive.

**Precedence** (highest to lowest): comparisons, `not`, `and`, `or`

```
participant.roles contains 'finance' and order.amount < 50000

entity.status in ['active', 'pending'] or participant.department == entity.department

not entity.deleted == true

(participant.roles contains 'admin' or participant.roles contains 'manager')
    and entity.classification != 'top-secret'
```

### Literals

| Type | Syntax | Example |
|------|--------|---------|
| String | Single quotes | `'finance'` |
| Integer | Digits | `50000` |
| Decimal | Digits with dot | `3.14` |
| Boolean | `true` / `false` | `true` |

## Service Method Policies

Apply `@AbacPolicy` to published service methods to enforce authorization before the call reaches the service. The platform evaluates the policy against the method's arguments and the caller's identity.

```typescript
import { AbacPolicy, Publish } from '@kinotic-ai/core'

@Publish('com.example')
class OrderService {

    @AbacPolicy("participant.roles contains 'finance' and order.amount < 50000")
    placeOrder(order: Order): void {
        // Only reached if the caller has the 'finance' role
        // AND the order amount is under 50,000
    }

    @AbacPolicy("participant.roles contains 'finance' and transfer.amount <= participant.transferLimit")
    transferFunds(transfer: Transfer, approval: Approval): void {
        // The caller must have the 'finance' role
        // AND the transfer amount must be under their personal limit
    }
}
```

### Parameter Name Resolution

In service method policies, non-reserved root identifiers are resolved against method parameter names. For a method like `transferFunds(transfer: Transfer, approval: Approval)`:

| Expression Path | Resolves To |
|----------------|-------------|
| `transfer.amount` | The `amount` field of the first argument |
| `approval.approved` | The `approved` field of the second argument |
| `participant.roles` | The caller's roles from the security context |

## Entity Policies

Apply `@AbacPolicy` to entities via `@EntityServiceDecorators` to enforce authorization at the data layer. Unauthorized records are never returned -- the platform filters them before they reach your code.

```typescript
import { Entity, AutoGeneratedId } from '@kinotic-ai/persistence'
import { EntityServiceDecorators, $AbacPolicy } from '@kinotic-ai/persistence'

@EntityServiceDecorators({
    allRead: [
        $AbacPolicy("entity.sharedWith contains participant.id")
    ],
    allCreate: [
        $AbacPolicy("participant.roles contains 'editor'")
    ],
    allDelete: [
        $AbacPolicy("participant.roles contains 'admin'")
    ]
})
@Entity()
export class Photo {
    @AutoGeneratedId
    id: string | null = null
    title: string = ''
    ownerId: string = ''
    sharedWith: string[] = []
}
```

### Operation Groups

| Group | Operations Covered |
|-------|-------------------|
| `allCreate` | `save`, `bulkSave` |
| `allRead` | `findById`, `findByIds`, `findAll`, `search`, `count`, `countByQuery` |
| `allUpdate` | `update`, `bulkUpdate` |
| `allDelete` | `deleteById`, `deleteByQuery` |

You can also target individual operations:

```typescript
@EntityServiceDecorators({
    findAll: [
        $AbacPolicy("entity.status in ['active', 'pending']")
    ],
    deleteById: [
        $AbacPolicy("participant.roles contains 'admin'")
    ]
})
```

### Dynamic Resource Sharing

Entity policies enable user-driven access control without creating dynamic policies. The policies themselves stay static — only the entity data changes.

**Example: Photo sharing**

The policy `entity.sharedWith contains participant.id` never changes. When a user shares a photo, the application updates the photo's `sharedWith` array. The next time anyone queries photos, the policy filters results to only include photos shared with the caller.

```typescript
class PhotoService {
    async sharePhoto(photoId: string, userId: string): Promise<void> {
        const photo = await this.photoEntityService.findById(photoId)
        photo.sharedWith.push(userId)
        await this.photoEntityService.update(photo)
    }

    // No authorization code here — the EntityService policy handles it
    async getMyPhotos(): Promise<Photo[]> {
        return await this.photoEntityService.findAll({ page: 0, size: 100 })
    }
}
```

## Combining Both Layers

Service method policies and entity policies work together:

```typescript
// Service-level enforcement — can this caller use this service at all?
@Publish('com.example')
class PhotoService {

    @AbacPolicy("participant.roles contains 'user'")
    async sharePhoto(photoId: string, userId: string): Promise<void> {
        const photo = await this.photoEntityService.findById(photoId)
        photo.sharedWith.push(userId)
        await this.photoEntityService.update(photo)
    }
}

// Persistence enforcement — which photos can this caller see?
@EntityServiceDecorators({
    allRead: [
        $AbacPolicy("entity.ownerId == participant.id or entity.sharedWith contains participant.id")
    ],
    allCreate: [
        $AbacPolicy("participant.roles contains 'user'")
    ],
    allDelete: [
        $AbacPolicy("entity.ownerId == participant.id")
    ]
})
@Entity()
export class Photo {
    @AutoGeneratedId
    id: string | null = null
    ownerId: string = ''
    sharedWith: string[] = []
}
```

In this example:
- The platform ensures only authenticated users with the `'user'` role can call `sharePhoto`
- The persistence layer ensures users only see photos they own or that are shared with them
- Only the photo owner can delete their photos
- The service code contains zero authorization logic — the platform handles it

## Role-Based Access Control

ABAC policies can express pure role-based checks:

```typescript
// Only admins
@AbacPolicy("participant.roles contains 'admin'")

// Admin or manager
@AbacPolicy("participant.roles contains 'admin' or participant.roles contains 'manager'")

// Must have both roles
@AbacPolicy("participant.roles contains 'finance' and participant.roles contains 'approver'")
```

RBAC is a subset of ABAC — no separate role-checking mechanism is needed.
