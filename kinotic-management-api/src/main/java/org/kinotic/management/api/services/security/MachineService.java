/**
 * Machine-identity management for the applications and projects of the caller's organization,

 * client with the identity's id as {@code clientId} and a secret issued here. An API client
 * of one application acts with that application's scope, exactly the position an application
 * end-user occupies; the machines the platform provisions for a project's deployment act with
 * the organization's scope. Every method derives the organization from the authenticated
 * participant: only org members may call, the application or project must belong to that
 * organization, and only its machines are visible or mutable.
