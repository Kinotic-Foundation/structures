# docker-kata-ch-test

Requirement verification for a `CLOUD_HYPERVISOR` node: real micro VMs run against a node
provisioned by `deployment/vm-node`, and each workload requirement is checked against
something observed — bytes that landed on disk, a process's executable, a line in a log
file — never against a flag we set. Results are written to `last-run.txt`.

```bash
sudo ./deployment/vm-node/setup-node.sh     # from the repository root, on the node
sudo ./deployment/vm-node/verify-node.sh
sudo bun run src/requirements-test.ts       # here
```

Unlike [`../kata-fc-test`](../kata-fc-test/README.md) and [`../boxlite-test`](../boxlite-test/README.md),
which were evaluation harnesses answering *can this runtime do X*, this test is the outcome of
that evaluation and runs against the node kit a production node is built with.

| Requirement | Checked by |
|---|---|
| R1 Customer code isolated in a microVM | Guest kernel differs from the host's, a `cloud-hypervisor` process backs it, and that process's command line names this container |
| R2 Logs shipped host-side | stdout and stderr land in the container's json-file with `stream` labels, and `LogPolicy` maps to Docker's rotation options |
| R3 Reaches as little as possible | IMDS and the WireServer refuse the guest, DNS still resolves, one workload cannot reach another's port, and `--network none` denies everything |
| R4 Fast edit/redeploy | A host-side edit under the shared mount is visible to the next workload with no image rebuild |
| R5 Read-only app code + writable logs | Both mounts present in one workload, and `readOnly` refused from inside the guest |
| R6 `VolumeMount.sizeLimitMb` | A 200MB write into a 64MB project quota lands 67043328 bytes |
| R7 Server sets the filesystem size | A 1500MB write into a 1024MB rootfs lands 1073676288 bytes |

Plus the lifecycle the provider depends on: a terminal exit code, a restart that keeps the
writable layer, and workloads a fresh process can discover.

With egress default-deny on, a container started outside the vm-manager has no network, which
is the point; the test starts its own containers, so it writes and removes the one resolver
rule its network probe needs. R1's hypervisor assertion ties the guest to the host side: the
shim names the Cloud Hypervisor API socket after the container id, so the test walks
`/proc/*/exe` for a `cloud-hypervisor` whose command line names this container.
